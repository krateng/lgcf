# Layered Graphics Container Format

This is a very simple file format to store multiple variations of an image where more than one independent feature differs. The repository includes a web-based reference implementation.

A possible use for this format could be a landscape painting where one corner of the area can be either a small fishing hamlet, a growing market town or an abandoned ruin; meanwhile a river could have different water levels or a bridge; and on a hill in the background there is a monastery that can be baroque, romanesque or gothic. Instead of creating a separate image for every possible combination, this image format would allow the user to easily cherry-pick desired features.
